Famous Dots
========================

Here we are showing the transitions and ability to create compliling interfaces in famo.us

Thoughts on implementation
------------

    Notes on sound and border: takes 10 dotes to fill top, another 10 dots to fill sides. 

    The sounds are on a scale and each progressive dot is the same sound at higher note up to 10 above.

    The squre note is the square sound at the same note as the next dot in the progression.


    TODO: Touching correctly on devices, the outer border, sounds
